#MACHINELEARNINGMODELS
#This project was purely on python using lazypredict,seaborn, tensorflow, matlab, matplotlib where I used datasets from kaggle and used them for classification of objects where I had to prove that support vector machines had the best accuracy. I did this with 98 percent for Non-Linear SVM and successfully finished this project at Defence Research Development Laboratory (DRDL) within one month under the guidance of Head of Artificial Intelligence at DRDL.
#LAZYPREDICT is a github repository by Shankar Pandala which is used to predict the objects based on their behaviour and we can find the line of best fit as well, to find accuracy we can used the lazy_accuracy to predict which model is best in terms of classifying the objects!
