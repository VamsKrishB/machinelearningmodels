#MACHINELEARNINGMODELS
#This project was purely on python using tensorflow, matlab, matplotlib where I used datasets from kaggle and used them for classification of objects where I had to prove that
support vector machines had the best accuracy. I did this with 98 percent for Non-Linear SVM and successfully finished this project at Defence Research Development Laboratory
(DRDL) within one month under the guidance of Head of Artificial Intelligence at DRDL.
